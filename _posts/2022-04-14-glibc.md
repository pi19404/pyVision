category: Linux

Introduction
-------------
In this article we will look at installation of Glib 2.25 installation on Ubuntu 16.04

Pre Requisite installation
-----

`sudo apt-get install autoconf`


Installation Steps
-----
```
mkdir ~/glibc_install; cd ~/glibc_install

wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/glibc-2.25.tar.gz

tar zxvf glibc-2.25.tar.gz

cd glibc-2.25

mkdir build

cd build

../configure --prefix=/opt/glibc-2.25

make -j4

sudo make install

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/glibc-2.25/lib
```

If OS does not support the glibc version for example 2.25 that you require . Then installing glibc in default prefix may cause the system to become unusable . This is because  glibc consists of many pieces (200+ shared libraries) which all must match. One of the pieces is ld-linux.so.2, and it must match libc.so.6, If all libraries do not match it would actually cause the system to be unusable as glibc is a very critical library . Hence its preferable to install glibc in alternate prefix

Errors

- ld.so.conf errors

`mkdir -p /opt/glibc-2.25/etc ;  touch /opt/glibc-2.25/etc/ld.so.conf`

echo these 2 lines in the .conf file

```
/usr/local/lib
/opt/lib
```
